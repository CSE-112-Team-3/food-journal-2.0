- Define the process of your sprints. Describe how you will operate as a team and define your sprint structure, style and 
timelines including sprint length, planning, reviews and retrospections, and reports

Sprint Length: 1 week 
Sprint Planning: done during our weekly meeting (Thursday 4-5pm)
Sprint Retrospective: during our weeky meeting
Structure: assign Github issues and assigned issue will be task to complete during sprint
Style: working solo or groups of 2 if it is a task with more story points

2) List down all your work effort.
- Break down larger problems into smaller scopes, and provide the links to the corresponding issues wherever applicable.
- Please use GitHub issues and project boards for issue tracking.

3) Estimate and prioritize your tasks.
- Once again, make sure to describe your process (e.g. time vs. story points, numerical or categorical scales etc.).
